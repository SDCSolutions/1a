Motorcycling is such a big part of my life. I started riding when I was 14. My dad had gotten an acting break that year and  he decided to get a motorcycle. At the time we had a friend of the family who could teach us how to ride as well. Unfortunately for my father, when he was learning how to ride, he got into a pretty scary accident where he sliced open his thigh when he put down the bike. It seems that as he put it down, it was the chain that cut him. However, he saw that I liked riding the bike and he did not sell it. Eventually, he ended up giving the bike to me and I have yet to not have a vehicle with two wheels when I can afford it.
