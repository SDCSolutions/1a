What is the billing rate?
------------------------
Work will be carried out at an hourly rate of $200/hr. I will be happy to send you a quote on the project you wish to initiate and negotiate with you on price if necessary. Once a quote is given and deliverables communicated and set in stone, anything beyond those deliverables will be charged at the hourly rate. All contracts will begin upon an intial deposit of 50% of the quote plus the cost of materials. The rest of payment will be due upon completion of the deliverables. Standard invoicing frequency is weekly and should be paid within 14 days from presentation of the invoice. Clients can choose their payment terms, invoicing frequency and deliverables to work out the hourly rates that will apply. Prices may be subject to change without notice.

What is the rate for an ongoing project?
------------------------
Consulting and designing that will be done on an ongoing basis is carried out at an hourly rate, Post-Pay basis.  For an order to be treated this way, specific approval in writing is required by SDC Solutions and it should not be assumed that all ongoing work will be carried out on a Post-Pay basis.

How can I review the documents you send me?
-------------------------------------------
Drawings, advice and calculations submitted for review will be provided as PDF files only. The PDF files will also be watermarked. Once these electronic review PDF files have been approved, then final PDF and/or manipulatable 3D format files (as agreed) will be provided without the watermark. This will only be done once they have been accepted and approved (as appropriate). Their validity and permission to use is conditional on full payment being received.

If drawings are required as DWG and/or DXF files, this must be clearly stated before anything is agreed and before any work has commenced. If DWG or DXF files are required, then the client must provide all symbols libraries, setup templates, layer templates, pen colours:pen width mapping, drawing sheet borders, font files, linetype files, etc. Only information that is provided will be used in preparing the drawings. 

What happens if I miss a payment?
---------------------------------
Failure to make payments in accordance with the agreed terms will result in all work stopping immediately, and permission to use work already provided will be withdrawn until such time as all outstanding payments have been made. Work will then recommence following a further deposit as above.

Will your rates go up?
----------------------
Rates are generally reviewed on January 1, each year, and may be revised from time to time as appropriate. These rates apply to all agreements that have been entered into that are for ongoing work. Clients with such agreements will be advised of any changes, however they should should check this page to ensure they know what the current rates for ongoing work are. If payments are not made in accordance with the terms of the agreement, the agreement will terminate and a fresh agreement will have to be entered into to reflect the new payment terms and the appropriate hourly rate.
