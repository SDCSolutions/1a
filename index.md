Welcome, this website is a collection of thoughts and ideas I have had as I work on multiple projects. The end goal is to have a personal library of work upon which I can reference in the future, a repository that will act as my Curriculum Vitae, as well as provide value to the people who read what I have written here. Many of the posts will be syndicated to either Linkedin, Facebook, Instagram, Medium, Youtube or Steemit but here will be the main hub for all content I post on the web. Try as I might to focus my interest on one body of knowledge, I am not wired to simply be content with one field of research. Thus, you will see here topics ranging from security, both in the physical sense and digital sense, art, fashion, technology, manufacturing, psychology, engineering, coding, motorcycles, marketing. I have done all this research to fix problems I have encountered and hope that what you read here will be useful to you.

For those of you who are interested in what I do professionally:

I have assisted with in raising over $50 million as well brought several products to market. My experience in working with testing labs as well as manufacturing techniques such as 3D Printing, machining, injection molding, casting, electronics, computers, programming and marketing can help bring your idea to reality. If you wish to make products to sell to others for more than just the chance of a royalty like you do with other invention services, click the Invention button. <a href="{{ 'invention' | relative_url}}" class="button big">{{page.cta}}</a>
